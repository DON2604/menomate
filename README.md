## Python Backend

### Overview
The Python backend of Menomate serves as the core for handling the AI-powered predictions, mood detection, and overall data processing. The backend is built using the **Flask** framework, which is lightweight yet robust, making it ideal for deploying machine learning models and serving API requests.

### Key Features
- **AI Models Integration**: The backend is responsible for running machine learning models that predict mood and menstrual cycle phases based on user input.
- **RESTful API**: The Flask server exposes multiple API endpoints that the mobile app interacts with, such as fetching tips, tracking health data, and delivering personalized suggestions.
- **Data Management**: User data is stored securely and handled efficiently with proper data pipelines to ensure smooth real-time analytics.

### AI and Machine Learning Models
- **Menstrual Health Prediction Model**: This model uses past cycle data to predict ovulation and periods, providing forecasts to the app.
- **Mood Detection Model**: The app takes user inputs (like answers to specific questions) and analyzes these responses to gauge the userâ€™s mental state.

### Flask API Endpoints
- `/tips/<category>`: Provides personalized health tips based on the category (e.g., "Stay hydrated and rest").
- `/mood_detection`: Accepts user inputs to assess mental health and return mood predictions.
- `/cycle_tracking`: Handles menstrual cycle data input and provides upcoming period/ovulation predictions.

### Backend Setup Instructions
1. Clone the backend repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DON2604/menomate.git
   cd backend2
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. The backend server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, and it will serve data to the mobile app via API calls.
